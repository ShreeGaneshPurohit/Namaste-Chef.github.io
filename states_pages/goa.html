 RECIPE: 
 


  <p>
   <br>
    First defrost prawns by either keeping them in water at room temperature water for 30 minutes or transfer the frozen prawns in the fridge compartment from the freezer. This will also thaw the prawns for using them the next day.
Next, add and mix all ingredients listed above in a big bowl and add thawed prawns in that bowl. <br> Keep them in the marinade for 10 minutes if you are in hurry. However If you have time, keeping these marinated prawns for longer than hour would make tandoori prawns even tastier.
After that skew these prawns on to skewers and cook them using any of the above mentioned methods. <br> You can use an oven or grill on a stove top as per your choice. Both processes are explained below:
Tandoori Prawns in an Oven
Preheat the oven at 200C. <br>
Brush marinated prawns with oil and grill for 10 Minutes. Actual time may vary from 9-12 minutes depending on the size of prawns you are using.
Brush them with melted butter after cooking for that extra flavor if you like that, or serve them hot as it is. <br>
Tandoori Prawn Recipe- Stove top Method
If you do not want to use an oven, simply make them over stove top. <br>
Heat a grill pan brush it with oil. When it is hot, place marinated prawn skewers and grill on medium heat for 2-3 minutes.
Then increase the heat and allow them to cook till they are slightly charred for that smoky flavour. <br>
Once done, sprinkle some chaat masala and serve them with sauce/chutney of your choice.

  <p>
   <br>
    Rinse mushrooms in water a few times using a colander or strainer. Trim the bottom part of the stalks and chop the mushrooms. Discard these.
Slice the onions thinly, slit the green chilies.
Making Mushroom Fry <hr>

Heat oil in a pan or kadai (wok).
Add the onions and saut√© stirring often till they begin to get light golden.
This process of cooking onions takes a lot of time. So, to quicken it, add a pinch of salt to the onions. This helps the onions to cook faster. <br>
The onions should have softness in them. So, when you see them beginning to get light golden, proceed to the next step. Don't make the onions crisp or browned.
Add the green chilies and saut√© for half a minute. <hr>
Now, add the chopped mushrooms and stir.
Add all the ground spice powders including salt as required.
 <hr>
Saut√© the mushrooms till they shrink in size and leave water.
Continue to cook till all the water has evaporated and you can see oil in the mixture.
Saut√© till the mushrooms turn light golden. The mixture should be dry. <hr>
Add coriander leaves. Stir and cook for a minute.
Switch off the heat and serve Mushroom Fry hot or warm with roti, bread or dinner rolls. <hr>

 RECIPE: 
 


  <p>
    <hr>
    Pluck the amaranth leaves with the tender stems. Then rinse these very well in water and then drain. 
    Chop them finely and keep aside. Also finely chop the onions, garlic and green chilies.
    Making Tambdi Bhaji 
    <hr>
    In a pan or kadai, heat 2 tbsp oil.
    Add the chopped onions, chopped green chilies and chopped garlic.
    Stir well and saute till the onions have softened and become translucent. <hr>
    Add ¬º tsp turmeric powder and stir.
    Then add the chopped amaranth leaves.
    Stir very well. Add salt. Stir again. <hr>
    Cover the pan or kadai with a lid and let the amaranth leaves cook on a low flame.
    
    Do check at intervals and if the moisture or water has dried up or if the leaves are sticking to the pan, add ¬º to 1/3 cup water. Stir, cover the pan and continue to cook. <hr>
    When the amaranth leaves are softened and cooked, add 1/3 cup grated coconut. It takes about 10 to 12 minutes on a low flame for the amaranth leaves to cook completely.
    Stir very well. Cover again and simmer on a low flame for 2 to 3 minutes. <hr>
    Switch off the flame. There should be no water in the dish. If there is any water, then evaporate the extra water by simmering without the lid. Check the taste and add more salt if required.
    Serve tambdi bhaji as a side dish with dal-rice or with chapatis or bread.

 RECIPE: 
 


  <p>
    <hr>
    Step 1
    In a medium saut√© pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until glistening, about 2 minutes. Add the onion and saut√© until translucent, about 5 minutes. 
    <hr> Add the tomato, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, and chile powder and saut√©, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes begin to break apart, about 5 minutes longer. <hr>
     Stir in the coconut paste and garam masala and cook until everything is well incorporated and the smell of coconut perfumes the air, about 5 more minutes. Add a little water, if needed, to achieve a loose gravy texture. Season with salt and set aside.
     <hr>
    
    Make the omelet:
    Step 2
    In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and season with the chile powder and salt. In a saut√© pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat and saut√© the onion and chile peppers, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. 
    <hr> Reduce the heat to medium and pour the eggs into the pan. Rotate the pan in a circle as the omelet cooks to ensure even distribution of the eggs. Once the center of the omelet is just set, 4 to 6 minutes, flip the omelet onto itself to form a half-moon shape. 
    <hr> Season with salt, transfer to a plate, and spoon the warm ros on top. Garnish with a lime wedge and raw onions.

 RECIPE: 
 


  <p> 
    <hr>
    Marinate The Fish
    Wash fish with water. Drain well and add it to a medium-size mixing bowl along with salt, turmeric powder, and lime juice. Mix well to coat the fish.
    Keep the bowl aside for 15 minutes. <hr>
    Make The Ground Goan Masala Paste
    Add coriander seeds, cumin seeds, fresh coconut, Kashmiri dry red chilies, garlic, black peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon stick along with ¬æ cup of water to a high-speed blender and blend to make a smooth paste.
    Scrape the sides of the blender a few times while blending. <hr>
    Make The Curry 
    Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
    Once the oil is hot, arrange the marinated fish in the skillet in a single layer and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side until lightly browned.
    Remove the fried fish on a plate and set it aside. <hr>
    In the remaining oil, add green chilies and fry for 3-4 seconds.
    Add onions and fry until they turn translucent (2-3 minutes).
    Add tomatoes and Kashmiri red chili powder to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes until the tomatoes are slightly mushy. <hr>
    Now add the ground masala paste that we made earlier to the skillet along with 1 cup of water, and tamarind paste, and mix well.
    Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 6-8 minutes until the oil starts to separate on the sides of the skillet.
    Add coconut milk and 2 cups of water and mix well  .
 <hr>  Add the cooked fish, and salt and bring the curry to a boil.
    Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3-4 minutes.
